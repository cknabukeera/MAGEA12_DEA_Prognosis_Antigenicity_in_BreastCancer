Overview

MAGEA12, a cancer-testis antigen remains one of the less characterized members of the MAGEA family, even with its potential role in breast cancer immunotherapy, its antigenicity is still undetermined and largely unexplored. While several MAGEA genes, such as MAGEA1, MAGEA3, and MAGEA4, MAGEA6 have been extensively studied and linked to various cancers, limited research has investigated MAGEA12’s expression patterns, prognostic significance, and potential as an immunotherapeutic target. IDC, accounts for 70 – 80% of BC cases, and has a 11% recurrence rate with only a third of its patients responding to chemotherapy, a main IDC treatment form hence necessitating antigen-tumor specific immunotherapy interventions hence this study. Our study presents 690 MAGEA12 peptides could be targeted in antigen-based immunotherapies or cancer vaccines for IDC BC, 64 HLA class I alleles that bind MAGEA12 strongly that can be utilized in specific HLA-antigen therapies, 10,000 TCR sequences that form high affinity stable TCR-pMHC complexes applicable in  adoptive T cell therapies.

This study aimed to characterize MAGEA12’s antigenicity, prognostic significance, and differential expression across molecular breast cancer subtypes. We integrated and analyzed 576 IDC BC cases from TCGA, 3 mRNA MAGEA12 spice variants, 40 SRA reads and 10,000 TCR sequences. 

Key Findings

Our study found MAGEA12 significantly differentially expressed in all IDC BC subtypes and significantly impacted overall survival in LumA subtypes patients,  identified 690 MAGEA12-derived peptides from three MAGEA12 mRNA splice transcript variants that bound with high affinity to  HLA class I alleles and forming stable pMHC complexes recognizable by TCR sequences forming high affinity TCR-peptide-MHC complexes, meeting key criteria for antigenicity and potential immunotherapeutic targeting.

Objectives

To investigate the expression, prognostic significance and Antigenic potential of MAGEA12 within the breast cancer molecular subtypes of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma patients.

Specific Objectives

i.	To analyze the differential expression of MAGEA12 in relation to other MAGE genes in healthy and IDC BC patients

ii.	To evaluate the association between MAGEA12 expression levels and patient survival outcomes

iii.	To identify antigenic MAGEA12 peptides with potential immunogenicity
